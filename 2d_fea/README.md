Analize the two-dimensional system for strength and stability and predict whether the construction can withstand applied forces.
Initially only snow load was meant to be applied.

Programming language - MATLAB.

For trusses - calculate stress and strain for each rod, calculate strength and stability safety factors.
For beams   - calculate stress and strain for each beam, calculate strength safety factor.
